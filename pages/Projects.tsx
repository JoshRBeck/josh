We collaborated with students from the UX/UI team to take their vision and create an app for helping choose the correct wine for your situation based on your mood or setting. For this project, we used both a back-end database and authentication system using MongoDB, and Express. For the front end, we used what we learned with HTML, CSS, Javascript and React to build the app.",
