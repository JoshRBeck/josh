      "Hey, I'm Josh Beck — originally from Vancouver, now calling Berlin home. After high school, my passion for travel led me to explore diverse cultures globally. Highlights? Fiji, a year each in Australia and New Zealand, and even a stint in South Korea for the Olympics. I'm an adventure seeker and sports enthusiast — Ice Hockey, Snowboarding, Skiing, Wakeboarding — I love them all. Plus, I'm a foodie, always on the hunt for new culinary experiences. Excited for the next chapter of my journey. Let's explore together!",
